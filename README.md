# Capstone
🏗️ Illegal Construction Detection using CNN & Geospatial Analysis

📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting unauthorized/illegal constructions using satellite imagery combined with Digital Elevation Models (DEM/DSM/DTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging geospatial techniques and machine learning, the system helps identify structural violations, supporting urban planning and regulatory enforcement.

📄 Research paper submitted for review at IKDD CODS 2025.

🔑 Key Features

-Automated detection of unauthorized constructions from aerial/satellite images.

-Integration of DEM data from Mapbox for accurate elevation modeling.

-Use of OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for spatial routing & analysis.

-CNN-based pipeline for image classification & anomaly detection.

-Geospatial visualization for urban planning and monitoring.
